description: "American Notes for General Circulation is a travelogue by Charles Dickens\
  \ detailing his trip to North America from January to June, 1842. Whilst there he\
  \ acted as a critical observer of North American society, almost as if returning\
  \ a status report on their progress. This can be compared to the style of his Pictures\
  \ from Italy written four years later, where he wrote far more like a tourist. His\
  \ American journey was also an inspiration for his novel Martin Chuzzlewit. Having\
  \ arrived in Boston, he visited Lowell, New York, and Philadelphia, and travelled\
  \ as far south as Richmond, as far west as St. Louis and as far north as Quebec.\
  \ The American city he liked best was Boston â€“ \"the air was so clear, the houses\
  \ were so bright and gay. [...] The city is a beautiful one, and cannot fail, I\
  \ should imagine, to impress all strangers very favourably.\" Further, it was close\
  \ to the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum for the Blind where Dickens\
  \ encountered Laura Bridgman, who impressed him greatly.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC\
